# 🥊 Coming Out Swinging

**A manifesto by Lawrence Turner**

> No more hiding. No more polite silence.

## 📖 About

This project is a living manifesto, blog, and web application prototype that documents the journey from a 2023 suicide attempt to building AI-powered tools for neurodivergent empowerment and data sovereignty.

## 🎯 The Loop

The core philosophy driving this project:

```
→ If I can see it, I can have it
→ If I can articulate it, my bots can make it
→ If my bots can make it, I can use it
→ REPEAT UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE
```

## 🚀 What's Built

- **HTML Manifesto**: Full-featured landing page with gradient design
- **AI Studio Prototype**: Interactive web app for users to visualize their AI-assisted workflows
- **GitHub Pages**: Live site at [turnerworks.github.io/coming-out-swinging](https://turnerworks.github.io/coming-out-swinging)

## 💡 The Movement

This isn't just about me. It's about:

- **Neurodivergent Empowerment**: Putting disabled and neurodivergent people at the centre, not the margins
- **Data Sovereignty**: Taking back control of our data - chips on keyrings, personal servers at home
- **Decentralization**: Moving life off hyperscale cloud back to citizen-controlled infrastructure
- **AI Autonomy**: Fighting fire with fire - using AI to reclaim our agency
